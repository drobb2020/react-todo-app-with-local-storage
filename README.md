<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This was a fantastic React tutorial by Chris Pennington on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRv73QZ7tw). The name of the channel is [Coding in Public](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodinginPublic). If you haven't checked out his channel I urge you to do so.
The application has both a light and a dark mode and you settings are all saved to local storage so the settings are remembered from you last session. You can also change to hue of the colors in either light or dark mode.

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments

Chris Pennington deserves the recognition for this React application. It is quite evident that he has placed a great deal of effort into this tutorial. This is a great introductory React project that anyone can learn a great deal from. I particularly like it that he did not simply use bootstrap to style the project but took the time to create his own style.
